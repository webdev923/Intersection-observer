# Polyfill

You can import the
[intersection-observer polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intersection-observer)
directly or use a service like [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/) to
add it when needed.

```
yarn add intersection-observer
```

Then import it in your app:

```js
import 'intersection-observer'
```

If you are using Webpack (or similar) you could use
[dynamic imports](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#import-), to only
load the Polyfill when needed.

```js
/**
 * Do feature detection, to figure out which polyfills needs to be imported.
 **/
async function loadPolyfills() {
  if (typeof window.IntersectionObserver === 'undefined') {
    await import('intersection-observer')
  }
}
```

## Browser support

[Browser support for the IntersectionObserver](http://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver)
is pretty good, but because Safari is still missing in action, you'll want to
include a polyfill.
