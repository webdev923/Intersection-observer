# Recipes

The IntersectionObserver itself is just a simple but powerful tool. Here's a few ideas for how you can use it.

## Lazy image load

It's actually easy to create your own lazy image loader, and this allows you to
build it according to your needs.

**Couple of tips**

- Make sure to set the
  [root margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin)
  for top and bottom, so the Intersection Observer gets triggered before the
  image enters the viewport. This gives the image a chance to be loaded before
  the user even sees it. Try and start with something like `200px 0px`, but
  experiment with until you find the right value
- Set `triggerOnce`, so you don't keep monitoring for changes.
- You should always create a wrapping element, that sets the correct aspect
  ratio for the image. You can set the padding bottom to be
  `${height / width * 100}%` to maintain aspect ratio.
- Either hide the `<img />` with CSS, or skip rendering it until it's inside the
  viewport.
- Don't set the `src` (or `srcset`) on the image until it's visible. Images will
  load their `src`, if even you set `display: none;`.

```jsx

export default LazyImage
```

    The threshold has been set to <code>1</code> on this example, so it won't
    load before it's fully inside the viewport.

  <LazyImage
    src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/mountains.jpg?auto=format&w=900&usm=20"
    alt="Mountainrange"
    width={900}
    height={506}
  />
